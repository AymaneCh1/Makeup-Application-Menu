          makeup at the age of 16.

        <p>
          I studied makeup at the Academy of makeup in Sydney & completed a
          <b

          Since establishing myself as a makeup artist, In 2019 my next venture
          was launching my very own cosmetic line “Savannah Rose Cosmetics”
          which had always been a dream of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I just wanted to create the best quality products to use on my
          clients, and be able to make that available for the rest of the world
          to use and love too.
        </p>

          My Cosmetic line isn’t just about makeup and cosmetics, its about
          people, helping people, its something that I as a person love doing
          and wanted to make my brand a part of that, by

            organisations to help better the community, wellbeing of others and
